# WQU-Applied-data-science-lab
The WQU Applied Data Science Lab is a sequence of eight projects, where you solve real-world problems using data science tools. Each project consists of four lessons and one assignment.
You'll work through the lessons at your own pace, following my code-along videos and exchanging ideas with other learners in the forum. Lessons are for experimentation (learning new concepts and practicing new coding techniques), so they're not graded. In the assignment, you'll demonstrate that you can successfully apply what you've learned in the lessons to a new dataset
## lab 1
We'll work with a dataset of homes for sale in Brazil. Your goal is to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate market. Also, you will look at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship between home size and price.
## lab 2
Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City
This project include:
<ol>

<li>create a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.</li>
<li>build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.</li>
<li>improve model performance by reducing overfitting.</li>
</ol>

## lab 3
in this project i learn:
<ol>
<li>How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.</li>
<li>How to prepare time series data for analysis.</li>
