# WQU-Applied-data-science-lab
The WQU Applied Data Science Lab is a sequence of eight projects, where you solve real-world problems using data science tools. Each project consists of four lessons and one assignment.
You'll work through the lessons at your own pace, following my code-along videos and exchanging ideas with other learners in the forum. Lessons are for experimentation (learning new concepts and practicing new coding techniques), so they're not graded. In the assignment, you'll demonstrate that you can successfully apply what you've learned in the lessons to a new dataset
